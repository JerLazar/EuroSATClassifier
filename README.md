# EuroSATClassifier

This project implements three CNN architectures: AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet for the purposes of image classification. Each model is implemented and trained on the EuroSAT dataset, which contains 27 000 satellite images. The training process spans 30 epochs for each network, allowing a comparative evaluation of their performance, accuracy, and training behavior.
